The APRS Gateway allows for one point of access into aprs.fi from the other
gateway programs that can generate APRS data. The purpose of this is to reduce
the load on aprs.fi and avoid contention between the other gateway programs when
accessing the aprs.fi network.

The Gateway has an ini file that contain the parameters for running the
software. The filename of the ini file is passed as a parameter on the command
line.

These programs build on 32-bit and 64-bit Linux as well as on Windows using
Visual Studio 2019 on x86 and x64.

This software is licenced under the GPL v2 and is primarily intended for amateur and
educational use.
